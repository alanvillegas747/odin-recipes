    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Meat for tacos al pastor is traditionally cooked on a spit, but this flavorful variation is made by cooking marinated meat in an Instant Pot or multi-functional pressure cooker. The result is a fall-apart, tender, flavor-infused pork taco that your family will request again and again.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>1/4 cup white vinegar</li>
        <li>1 medium orange, lime, juiced</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of chili powder and vegetable oil</li>
        <li>12 10-inch flour tortillas.</li>
        <li>1/8 chopped cilantro</li>
        <li>20 ounces of drained pineapple chunks</li>
        <li>3 pounds of pork butt, cut into 2-inch cubes</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place pork into a large lidded container.</li>
        <li>Blend pineapple juice, onion, vinegar, orange juice, lime juice, garlic, chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, sazón, chili powder, salt, cumin, and black pepper in a blender until smooth. Pour over pork and toss until all meat is covered. Seal the container and marinate for at least 8 hours or up to 24 hours. </li>
        <li>Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot), select the Sauté function, and add vegetable oil. When hot, add marinated pork and brown on all sides, working in batches if necessary, about 5 minutes per batch. Reserve any extra marinade in the lidded container. </li>
        <li>Turn off the Sauté function. Pour in reserved marinade, then close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to the manufacturer's instructions; set the timer for 35 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build. </li>
        <li>Release the pressure using the natural-release method according to the manufacturer's instructions, about 10 minutes. Release the remaining pressure with the quick release method, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. </li>
        <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. </li>
        <li>Transfer pork to the prepared baking sheet. Keep any sauce in the Instant Pot. Use forks to coarsely shred the pork, removing and discarding any excess fatty chunks. Spread meat out evenly onto the baking sheet. Add pineapple chunks. </li>
        <li>Broil in the preheated oven until the tips of the meat and pineapples are beginning to get a little brown and crispy, about 5 minutes. Remove from the oven. </li>
        <li>Drizzle the reserved sauce from the Instant Pot over pork to moisten it and add more flavor. Arrange pork and pineapple chunks on tortillas. Add onion, pico de gallo, avocado, and cilantro. Garnish with lime wedges. </li>
    </ol>
